# Cancer Danger Degree Classification with SVM

## 🔄 Overview:
In this project, we aim to classify the degree of danger of cancer by utilizing Support Vector Machines (SVM) and various data analysis techniques. The dataset used in this project consists of several hundred human cell sample records and their cell characteristics. We will use the tools like piplite, pandas, matplotlib, numpy, seaborn, scikit-learn, and scipy to clean and pre-process the data, train and test the SVM model, and evaluate its performance.

## 🎊 Motivation:
The early detection of cancer can greatly improve the chances of successful treatment. This project aims to classify the degree of danger of cancer based on the cell characteristics, providing valuable information for medical professionals to make informed decisions.

## 🏁 Learning Objectives:
1)	To become familiar with SVM and its application in classification problems
2)	To understand the process of loading, cleaning, and pre-processing data
3)	To learn how to train, test, and evaluate a machine learning model
4)	To gain experience in using various data analysis techniques and visualization tools like pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn

## ⚙️ Technical Aspects:
In this project, we will use SVM to classify the degree of danger of cancer. We will load the data using pandas, clean and pre-process the data, and then split it into training and testing sets. Then we will train the SVM model using scikit-learn, evaluate its performance, and practice making predictions on new data.

## 🧰 Technology used:
The project will use piplite, pandas, matplotlib, numpy, seaborn, scikit-learn, scipy, itertools and pylab.

## 📚 Data Source:
The dataset used in this project is publicly available from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and consists of several hundred human cell sample records.

## 🗂️ Project Structure:
The project will consist of the following stages.
1)	Installation
2)	Load the Cancer data
3)	Load Data from CSV File
4)	Data pre-processing and selection
5)	Train/Test dataset
6)	Modeling (SVM with Scikit-learn)
7)	Evaluation
8)	Practice
